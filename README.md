# Nowcasting-Nets

This repository contains codes to our proposed Nowcasting-Nets models in the **Nowcasting-Nets: Deep Neural Network Structures for Precipitation Nowcasting Using IMERG** paper. The ```Models.py``` file contains the details of our proposed models and the rest of the files are used to properly read the data (here), generate hyperparameter tuning experiments, and create, train and save the models.
