# Nowcasting-Nets

This repository contains codes to our proposed Nowcasting-Nets models in the **Nowcasting-Nets: Deep Neural Network Structures for Precipitation Nowcasting Using IMERG** paper. The ```Models.py``` file contains the details of our proposed models and the rest of the files are used to properly read the data ([here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1aBSx4s7GegvtHOpkCerArvavYuSokfm7?usp=sharing)), generate hyperparameter tuning experiments, and create, train and save the models.
